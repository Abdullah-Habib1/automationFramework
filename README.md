--> Test Cases covered was as following

started with test cases that will lead a user to remain at the registeration page.

--- Tested registeratin with invalid email that contains 2 @ signs [email created from java faker lib +'@']. (Passed)
--- Tested registeratin with invalid Phone number and here I used empty phone number. (Passed)

--- Tested password format acceptance through using a numeric password that does not contain the required format (Failed)
--- Tested Password limit, That I used to register a pw more than 8 ltters (Failed)
--- Tested First and Last names should start with capital letters, That I changed any capital letters in the names created from java faker with a small letter and tried to register with. (Failed)

--> As there are multiple failures as mentioned above, I used soft assertions for some of cases to continue my test and catch as much as issue automation can get.

--> The last case was failed and terminated the browser and created the TestNG report as required.

--> On Failures, ScreenShots are taken and are supposed to be saved at the screenshots folder.

--> The response of hitting the register API is supposed to be saved to a text file in the Logs folder.
